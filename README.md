# How to Set Up a TeamSpeak Server on a VPS

This guide will walk you through step-by-step on how to configure and run a TeamSpeak server on a VPS (Virtual Private Server). A TeamSpeak server is a great option for real-time voice communication, whether it's for online gaming, team meetings, or any other scenario that requires clear and efficient communication.

## Prerequisites

- Access to a VPS with a supported operating system (Linux, Windows)
- Basic knowledge of command line and server administration

## Steps

### 1. Choose Your VPS

Ensure that your VPS meets the minimum system requirements to run the TeamSpeak Server. Check your VPS provider's specifications to make sure you have enough CPU, RAM, and bandwidth resources to support the expected number of users.

### 2. Connect to Your VPS

Use your preferred SSH client to connect to your VPS. You will need the IP address of your VPS and the login credentials provided by your hosting provider.

Example SSH command: ssh your_username@your_vps_ip_address

### 3. Download and Install TeamSpeak Server

1. Download the latest TeamSpeak server package from the [official website](https://www.teamspeak.com/en/downloads/#server).
2. Transfer the downloaded file to your VPS using SCP or your preferred file transfer method.
3. Unpack the downloaded file.
4. Navigate to the newly unpacked TeamSpeak server directory.
5. Run the server startup script to start the TeamSpeak server. The script is usually named `ts3server_startscript.sh`.

### 4. Configure Your TeamSpeak Server

After starting the server, you can access the TeamSpeak server administration interface via a web browser by entering your VPS IP address followed by port 10011 (e.g., `http://your_ip_address:10011`). Follow the instructions to create an administrator and set the administrator password.

### 5. Accessing Your TeamSpeak Server

Use a TeamSpeak client (such as the [TeamSpeak Client](https://www.teamspeak.com/en/downloads/)) to connect to your server. Enter your VPS IP address in the client's address bar, along with the username and password you configured earlier.

### 6. Additional Configurations

- Customize user permissions and channels as needed.
- Consider setting up a database server to store server configurations and chat logs.
- Explore other advanced settings to optimize the security and performance of your TeamSpeak server.
